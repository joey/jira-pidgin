Turns jira CRs in IM text in to clickable links.

Requires: 
 - pidgin 2.7.x (2.6.x has a bug in the perl plugins)
     

Install:
 - Edit your URL in to the script
 - copy it to ~/.purple/plugins/
 - Restart pidgin, enable in the plugin setup


To do:
 - This should in theory work with windows Pidgin & active perl but
   I don't know how to set up.
 - Prefs Panel for the URL instead of editing the perl script
 - Support for multiple base-URLs (depending on project name?)
